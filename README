I would like to dedicate this to the people who were a constant source of inspiration and 
guidance for me in my journey to learn CSS. So guys this is my way of humbly saying thank 
you for all the time and effort you put in to creating beautiful code and share it freely. 

I am very much humbled by you... this is FOR:

  Lea Verou
  Chris Coyier
  Simurai
  
  and many many others who I will start listing when time permits me to do so...

#TODO:

1 - Firefox only right now, need to work on Chrome Safari Opera and IE(yuck!)
2 - Audio lag needs new audio object so multiple instances can play immediately...
3 - Webkit does not support mouseleave so now what ?? Any work arounds ? 
4 - Z-index:0 for #logo works fine in firfox but breaks in chrome (why ?) - z-index:-4 fixes chrome
5 - Released under GPL with just one request, do as you wish with the code but please SHARE it !
