I would like to dedicate this to the people who were a constant source of inspiration and guidance for me in 
my journey to learn CSS. So guys this is my way of humbly saying thank you for all the time and effort you put in to 
creating beautiful-clean-efficient code then actually share it freely. 

I am very much humbled by you... this is FOR:

  Lea Verou
  Chris Coyier
  Simurai
  and many many others who I will start listing when time permits me to do so...
